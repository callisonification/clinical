    <h3>Company Overview</h3>

    <h3>The Clinical-Security Approach</h3>
    <p>In most hospitals Information Assurance is viewed as a necessary evil; and secondary to patient care. We believe that IA is one facet of the patient care experience. We help you to determine process centric and performance-driven goals; while also considering HIPAA security implications and the human factor concerns of healthcare. We are security coaches and advocates, focused on helping to you receive the greatest value from your technology.</p>
    <p>We believe that security-focused healthcare must first be a quality-focused business. Your reputation, revenue and most importantly, your patients, is at risk. To address data security you must make an unfettered examination of how you work; and how you protect patient health information today. The law-enforcement and Information Security professionals of Clinical Security make a difference in the organizational mindset and patient care quality of every hospital we serve.</p>
